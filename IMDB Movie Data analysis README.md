## Overview

This project analyzes the data sourced from Academy XI which is IMDB movies which gives information about movies from 2010 to 2018. Descriptive analysis of movie gross and ratings shows the money made domestic or internation. We can use this analysis to choose which studio are the best and make high rated movies.

## Business Problem

Top movies can be made with highest revenue using this data analysis by choosing are the movies supposed to be launched domestic or international, how does the movie rating effect the money made by movies and the best studios which make the movies. Based on this analysis, business in movies can be more productive.
